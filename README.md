# Covid-19 deaths in Sweden

This shows a visualizaiton of covid-19 deaths in Sweden. It pulls data from Folkh√§lsomyndigheten and displays it as they update.

[Live demo here](https://blog.nimishg.com/public/covid19sweden/covid_status.html)

The code uses d3js, charts.js and a tiny bit of python for preprocessing

It should be easy enough to get going by just going into the `build` directory and running `./get_data.sh` and then navigating to `covid_stats.html`
